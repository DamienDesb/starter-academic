abstract: "The Subpolar North Atlantic is known for rapid reversals of decadal temperature trends, with ramifications encompassing the large-scale meridional overturning and gyre circulations,
Arctic heat and mass balances, or extreme continental weather. Here, we combine datasets
derived from sustained ocean observing systems (satellite and in situ), idealized observationbased
modelling (advection-diffusion of a passive tracer), and a machine learning technique
(ocean profile clustering) to document and explain the most-recent and ongoing cooling-towarming
transition of the Subpolar North Atlantic. Following a gradual cooling of the region
that was persisting since 2006, a surface-intensified and large-scale warming sharply
emerged in 2016 following an ocean circulation shift that enhanced the northeastward
penetration of warm and saline waters from the western subtropics. The long ocean memory
of the Subpolar North Atlantic implies that this advection-driven warming is likely to persist in
the near-future with possible implications for the Atlantic multidecadal variability and its
global impacts."
